# Snowflake Analytics Engineering Validation Toolkit

## Purpose
This repository contains a set of Python scripts designed to perform **data validation, monitoring, and operational checks** in Snowflake. The goal of this 
toolkit is to have the ability to grab items that are not utilized on an everyday basis, but will save time in the future. 

This repo includes:

- Data quality checks (duplicates, nulls, referential integrity)
- Pipeline validation (row counts, outlier detection)
- Task monitoring (detect failed Snowflake tasks)
- Reusable, modular Python code for production use
